# AoC 2023

Trying a functional language *(also haskell seemed too hard)*

---

### Files
`bin/DAY/` for the daily solutions
`lib/` for useful functions
`template/` basic starting point

### Helper
```sh
./script.sh create DAY
./script.sh create 01
```
Copy the template in `bin/DAY`

```sh
./script.sh run DAY first/second
./script.sh run 01 first
```
Run the first or second part from that day with `input.txt`

```sh
./script.sh sample DAY first/second
./script.sh sample 01 first
```
Same as `run` but with `sample.txt`
